# 💰 Personal Expense Tracker — Mini Project

A small personal finance tool with three interfaces that share the same CSV backend:

- **CLI**: `expense_tracker.py` — add / view / delete / summary / plot / export
- **Streamlit Web App**: `streamlit_app.py` — browser UI with forms and charts
- **Tkinter Desktop App**: `tkinter_app.py` — simple offline GUI

This README explains how to set up the project, run each interface, and debug common issues.
